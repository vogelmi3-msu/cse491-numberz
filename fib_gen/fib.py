# this is an implementation of the 'fib' functionality using
# a generator.

def fib():
	last_1 = 1
	last_2 = 1
	
	while 1:
		next_fib = last_1 + last_2
		last_1, last_2 = last_2, next_fib
		yield next_fib

# additional questions to address:
# - could you swap the last two lines of the while statement?  what are the
#    plusses and minuses of doing so?
# - is there a way to condense the 'while' loop into two statements? try
#    getting rid of the next_fib variable.
